DAP project, PyTorch, LSTM model

This is for Yuan's Data Analysis Project. 
I want to implment LSTM-CRF autoencoder in PyTorch.

The data pre-processing part is done.
LSTM in PyTorch training part is done.
I am implementing the evaluation part now...

Some of the code is from https://github.com/glample/tagger

We will use the following dataset now, text chunking
